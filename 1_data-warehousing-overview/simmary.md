## Overview

This video provides a comprehensive overview of modern data warehousing concepts, architectural trends, and practical considerations. It begins with why data warehouses are needed—to offload analytical workloads from OLTP systems and provide a centralized platform for decision-making.

Topics covered include:
- The purpose of a data warehouse in relation to OLTP systems
- Kimball vs Inmon methodologies
- The role of data lakes and lakehouses
- Concepts like data mesh and data fabric
- Common failure points in projects
- Agile delivery, training, and user engagement
- Modern tools (e.g., Azure Synapse, Power BI, Delta Lake)

The speaker emphasizes blending traditional and modern architectures to meet business needs and deliver long-term value through planning, governance, and iterative implementation.
