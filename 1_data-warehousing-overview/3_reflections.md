# Reflections

## Key Takeaways
- Offloading analytical queries from OLTP systems is a crucial benefit of a dedicated data warehouse. This point helped me connect system performance with architecture decisions.
- The difference between Kimball and Inmon was clearer than I expected. 
- Data lakes and lakehouses add flexibility, but they introduce complexity — especially around security, governance, and user experience.
- I hadn’t fully understood the challenges of implementing data mesh. The idea of “data as a product” is powerful, but the organizational change it demands is non-trivial.

## Personal Learning
- I realized how common it is for projects to fail due to poor scoping, lack of planning, or ignoring data quality. This reinforces the need to balance technical design with soft skills and project management.
- Tools like Power BI or Tableau not only help users but also accelerate feedback loops through prototyping — something I plan to apply in my own work.

## Next Steps
- Review a real-world warehouse project to identify how modeling choices were made.
- Try designing a mini data mart using the Kimball star schema approach.
